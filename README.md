## Overview

![overview](https://github.com/jorgeluis-ardila/learning-web-catalog/blob/main/src/assets/overview-web-catalog.jpg)

You can find the demo [here](https://jorgeluis-ardila.github.io/learning-web-catalog/). This project is made with the purpose to practice and consolidate my knowledge about Javascript bases. You will be able to find a Web Catalog with objective of display the La Lana Land's products generating an easy way to share their products.

**User stories**
- I can see a list of products with its name, price and image
- I can sort the products for price, name
